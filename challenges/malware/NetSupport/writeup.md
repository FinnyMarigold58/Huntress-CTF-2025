# NetSupport
**CTF:** Huntress CTF 2025
**Category:** Malware  
**Points:** 10  
**Challenge Description:**

```md
An unexpected Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tool was identified on this laptop. We identified a suspicious PowerShell script written to disk at a similar time. Can you find the link between the two?
```

## Initial Observations

Upon first opening the netsupport file, it is obviously a short downloader. After running playground.ps1 and downloading the zip.

I started decompiling the client32.exe and after reaching a stumble, I decided to check all the config (.ini) files. What would you know, inside client32.ini is a field labeled "Flag" set to `ZmxhZ3tiNmU1NGQwYTBhNWYyMjkyNTg5YzM4NTJmMTkzMDg5MX0NCg==` base64ing this out to recieve the flag `flag{b6e54d0a0a5f2292589c3852f1930891}
`
