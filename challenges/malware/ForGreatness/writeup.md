# For Greatness
**CTF:** Huntress CTF 2025
**Category:** Malware  
**Points:** 10  
**Challenge Description:**

```md
Oh great, another phishing kit. This has some functionality to even send stolen data over email! Can you track down the email address they send things to?
```

## Initial Observations

Upon opening j.php, there is just lots of escaped string sequences. Using cyberchef we can work through and make sense of all these variables. Notingly, there is a large variable which is most likely the encoded payload.

After unescaping the code, and following the path we see that the big payload gets base64 decoded, then gzuncompressed. All things that cyberchef can do!

After this we get our stage2, which is noticably small with another long variable, stage3.

Unbase64ing the variable gives us more php code. Stage 3 is our final stage and where the meat of the payload is. We see the interior logic, noting a mailTo function with a interesting email: `<ghost+}f7113307018770d52d4f94fec013197f{galf@greatness.com>`. After reversing the email we are left with the flag!

Flag: `flag{f791310cef49f4d25d0778107033117f}`
